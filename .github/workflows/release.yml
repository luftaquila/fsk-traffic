            ## Note
            ### Firmwares
            Use [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) to upload the firmware to the device and set the device IDs.  

            All controllers and sensors must have their ID in the flash memeory. Ensure that the value `0xBADACAFE` is stored at the memory address 0x0803FF00 and device ID at 0x0803FF04.

            The device IDs assigned to the sensors are 1 ~ 200, and 201 ~ 254 are for the controllers. ID 0 and 255 should be avoided as these values are reserved for `ID_BROADCAST` and `ID_INVALID`.

            ### Desktop Application
            Before open the `fsk-traffic-control` executable, download `fsk-entry.json` and put it in the same directory with the executable.

            In MacOS, run the following command before open the installed `fsk-traffic-control` for the first time.\
            Unless, it will say `"fsk-traffic-control" is damaged and canâ€™t be opened.` because the packages are not signed.

            ```sh
            cd /path/to/fsk-traffic-control
            xattr -c fsk-traffic-control.app
            chmod +x fsk-traffic-control.app/Contents/MacOS/fsk-traffic-control
            ```
